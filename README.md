## üéØ Task    
Development of a multipage application using streamlit [(Streamlit service deployed on HuggingFace Spaces)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AntNikYab/NaturalLanguageProcessing):

- Page 1 ‚Ä¢ Review Classification for Polyclinics

        User-entered review classification model
        Outputs prediction results by three models:
        1) Classic ML algorithm (Logistic Regression) trained on BagOfWords representation
        2) LSTM model
        3) BERT-based
        Alongside the prediction, the time it was obtained is displayed
        The page features a comparative table based on the f1-macro metric for all constructed classifiers

- Page 2 ‚Ä¢ Text Generation with GPT Model

        Generative model 
        Users can adjust the length of the generated sequence
        The number of generations, temperature, top-k/p, maximum length, and the number of generated sequences can be controlled
